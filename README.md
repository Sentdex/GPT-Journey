Make sure to sign up for your API Key from Open AI

To find or create your OpenAI API key, follow these steps:

Visit the OpenAI website: Go to https://www.openai.com/.

Sign in or sign up: If you already have an account, click "Sign in" at the top right corner of the page, and enter your login credentials. If you don't have an account, click "Get started" to sign up for one.

Access the API section: After logging in, navigate to the API section, which is usually available in the dashboard or user menu.

Locate or create your API key: Once you're in the API section, you should see your API key listed. If you have never created an API key before, there should be an option to generate one.

Keep your API key secure: Remember to keep your API key confidential and not share it with others, as it provides access to your account and its associated resources.

Save the API key into a text file called key.txt


--IMPORTANT NOTE--
You will need Stable Diffusion already installed and running locally on your machine with the commandline argument --api before you launch.
In your Stable Diffusion launch.py file, edit the file and search for "commandline", inside the "" add --api then run Stable Diffusion. Then double click to open the launch.cmd file inside the GPT-Journey folder or you can "python GPT-Journey.py" yourself from a commandline.
